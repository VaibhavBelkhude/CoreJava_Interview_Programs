Points to Note
It is an optional part of a SOAP message.

Header elements can occur multiple times.

Headers are intended to add new features and functionality.

The SOAP header contains header entries defined in a namespace.

The header is encoded as the first immediate child element of the SOAP envelope.

When multiple headers are defined, all immediate child elements of the SOAP header are interpreted as SOAP header blocks.
