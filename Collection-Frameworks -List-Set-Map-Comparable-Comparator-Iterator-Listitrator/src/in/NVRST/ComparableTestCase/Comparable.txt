Java Comparable interface:
========================
Java Comparable interface is used to order the objects of the user-defined class. 
This interface is found in java.lang package and contains only one method named
 compareTo(Object). It provides a single sorting sequence only, i.e., 
 you can sort the elements on the basis of single data member only. 
 For example, it may be rollno, name, age or anything else.

compareTo(Object obj) method
=============================
public int compareTo(Object obj): It is used to compare the current object with
 the specified object. 
 It returns
1)positive integer, if the current object is greater than the specified object.
2)negative integer, if the current object is less than the specified object.
3)zero, if the current object is equal to the specified object.

We can sort the elements of:
===========================
1)String objects

3)User-defined class object
Collections class provides static methods for sorting the elements of collections.
